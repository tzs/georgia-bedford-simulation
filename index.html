This page shows an ideal first digit distribution according to Benford's Law,
and the first digit distribution of simulated voting in Georgia counties, based
on the number of registered voters actually in each country, and a user specified
voter turnout and percent vote for a particular candidate.
<p>
You can switch between showing the reference Benford distribution and the
simulated distribution using the two buttons directly under the distribution
display.
<p>
To use this most effectively, first look at the ideal reference distribution.
Then look at the simulation.
Note how they differ.
<p>
Then try changing voter turnout or the percentage the candidate receives.
As you change these values using the up/down arrows, the distribution will update.
<p>
Note how even small changes in turnout or the candidate's percentage can cause
big changes in the distribution.
The reason for this is that the underlying county populations (and the
corresponding number of registerered voters in each) does not
follow Benford's Law.
<p>
If you want to see that distribution, crank the voter turnout and candidate
percentage both up to 100.
<p>
A more realistic simulation would vary the turnout and the candidate's percentage
by county.
In the 2020 US election, for example, Trump got higher percentages in smaller
population counties and Biden got higher percentages in larger population counties.
Adding those refinements would not improve the conformance to Benford's Law.
It would just change to giving a different set of non-Benford results than
the simplified simulation gives.
